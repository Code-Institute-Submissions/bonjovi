## Bonjovi
This site is dedicated to the Band's fans and offers them the ability to access their music, most updated articles
and above all the ability to purchase their merchandise.
The site color has been chosen in line with the latest album called '2020' which gives a strong impact as it is mainly 
black however the grey/red used throughout the site is reflecting the logo palette.


## Site Structure
The menu of the site is quite simple with a navigation focused first on the band's social media and fans account.
It gives the fans the ability to reach out to their favourite band but also getting info on their tour dates, listen to their
music, purchase their merchandise by categories, and be part of the jbj xp. 

The top navigation provides:
--links to the band's official social media accounts
--the users' account: provides the ability to login to an existing account, create an account by registering, upon registration, it
offers a link to their profile and the option to logout, and if the user is a super user there is a product management link added
to either add a new product, edit, update or delete an existing one.
--view of their current shopping bag.

The menu is as follow:
--Home -- the logo also brings you back to the homepage
--JBJ Boutique -- offers a dropdown by category
--Tour -- gives information on the band next tour appereances
--Music -- provides the user with a large selection of the band's albums and ability to either buy or stream them

Toast messages have been put in place to accompany the users throughout their interactions in the site, whether it is when registering
purchasing a product, logging in, logging out...

The homepage is a generic page where the user can get familiar with the jbj experience, which are products subscriptions to the band's3
inside stories. it also gives the user a view of the latest album and then can also read the latest articles written.

The JBJ Boutique is the ecommerce part of the site where users/visitors can see all the items displayed by categories.
Upon surfing on this page, the users can sort the products as well as make a search to find their favourite items.

The Tour page will send the users to the upcoming tours events the bands organised, currently none is set.

The Music page gives the users the ability to chcek every album and presented in a flip card, the album title and tracks as well as an option
that directs them to the official channels to buy or stream online their songs.

## User stories
As a user I would like to feel close to the band, I would want a site that is easy to use, easy to navigate and gets me to sign up
and eventually purchase some items.
For that reason, the use of impactful images of the band is important. I am happy seeing the band and having the ability to 
be part of the jbj experience gives a sense of closeness to them.
As a user being able to register by providing a simple email and password to the 'fan club' is bringing me closer to the band. 
When navigation through the boutique, being able to see the products by category helps me as a user filter what I am looking for, and if 
I am interested in the cheapest product for example I can use the sort out option provided. 
Once the product selected, the toast message gives me an indication that it has been added to my basket which is a nice update to have as it also provides me with the 
option to either checkout ie purchase or continue shopping.
As a user if I want to checkout and find out on the page that I can benefit from free delivery it will entice me to purchase some more,
which I can do by choosing the go back to shopping option.
As a user it is also important for me to know that the purchases are secure. So after purchasing, an order number is displayed and a confirmation email will be sent.
If as a user I have an account, my order history will be displayed in my profile as a nice reminder and also to avoid purchasing the same products or simply as a folow up if 
there are delivery issues.
As a user having the option to purchase without registering is great. 
However any fan would want to register and have a profile so as a user I am happy to find that option on display on the top navigation.
When looking at the music page, as a user it shows me what are the latest albums but giving the option to buy or stream enhance my will to listen to the track without worrying about
the legality of it.

As a superuser, it is important for me to know that I am the only person whom can be in charge of the Boutique's product management.
Once logged in as a superuser, I will be interested in adding a product, editing an existing one, updating and deleting if products are out of stock.
and also making sure all the images load properly before logging out safely.

## Features

## Features for the future

## 




**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
